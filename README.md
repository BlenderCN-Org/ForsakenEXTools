# Forsaken EX Tools
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svkaiser/ForsakenEXTools/master/image.png)
This repo contains various python scripts for Blender that was used for developing the exclusive content for the Forsaken remaster (https://store.steampowered.com/app/668980/Forsaken_Remastered/).

There are some things that are incomplete such as subdivision and full working import of .COB and .MXL files. These scripts were originally developed for personal use and as such, may not be completely user-friendly. Any contributions to further improve these scripts are always welcomed.

## Getting Started

Copy the entire /scripts folder into your Blender's /scripts directory. The scripts can then be loaded by going to File->User Preferences and then select the Add-ons tab. The script is located under the Import-Export category under the name "Forsaken tools".

Tutorials will slowly become available over time.

### Prerequisites

You will need Blender version 2.77 at the minimum

## Contributing

I am open to any sort of contributions from the community
